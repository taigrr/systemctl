# systemctl

This library aims at providing idiomatic `systemctl` bindings for go developers, in order to make it easier to write system tooling using golang.
This tool tries to take guesswork out of arbitrarily shelling out to `systemctl` by providing a structured, thoroughly-tested wrapper for the `systemctl` functions most-likely to be used in a system program.

If your system isn't running (or targeting another system running) `systemctl`, this library will be of little use to you.

## What is systemctl

`systemctl` is a command-line program which grants the user control over the systemd system and service manager.

`systemctl` may be used to introspect and control the state of the "systemd" system and service manager. Please refer to `systemd(1)` for an introduction into the basic concepts and functionality this tool manages.

## Supported systemctl functions

- [x] `systemctl daemon-reload`
- [x] `systemctl disable`
- [x] `systemctl enable`
- [x] `systemctl reenable`
- [x] `systemctl is-active`
- [x] `systemctl is-enabled`
- [x] `systemctl is-failed`
- [x] `systemctl mask`
- [x] `systemctl restart`
- [x] `systemctl show`
- [x] `systemctl start`
- [x] `systemctl status`
- [x] `systemctl stop`
- [x] `systemctl unmask`

## Helper functionality

- [x] Get start time of a service (`ExecMainStartTimestamp`) as a `Time` type
- [x] Get current memory in bytes (`MemoryCurrent`) an an int
- [x] Get the PID of the main process (`MainPID`) as an int
- [x] Get the restart count of a unit (`NRestarts`) as an int

## Useful errors

All functions return a predefined error type, and it is highly recommended these errors are handled properly.

## Context support

All calls into this library support go's `context` functionality.
Therefore, blocking calls can time out according to the caller's needs, and the returned error should be checked to see if a timeout occurred (`ErrExecTimeout`).

## Simple example

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "time"

    "github.com/taigrr/systemctl"
)

func main() {
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 10*time.Second)
    defer cancel()
    // Equivalent to `systemctl enable nginx` with a 10 second timeout
    opts := systemctl.Options{ UserMode: false }
    unit := "nginx"
    err := systemctl.Enable(ctx, unit, opts)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("unable to enable unit %s: %v", "nginx", err)
    }
}
```
